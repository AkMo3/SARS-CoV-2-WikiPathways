# SARS-CoV-2-WikiPathways

Temporary repository of RDF of selected pathways from WikiPathways, supporting the Wikidata bot.

Both the source files are in this repository, as are the `.zip` files to be used by the bot.
These zip files are created/updated with these commands:

```shell
zip wikipathways-SARS-CoV-2-rdf-authors.zip authors/*
zip wikipathways-SARS-CoV-2-wp-rdf.zip wp/Human/*
```
